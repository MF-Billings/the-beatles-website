# the-beatles-website
A website I made for my Web Development course in University using HTML, CSS, and PHP

In order to view the 'website' (it's really just a bunch of files on your computer) as intended you'll need the ability to run php files locally.  I accomplished this by downloading something called XAMPP which allows you to run PHP files offline from your own PC.  It also comes with SQL which was used to store the discography information.

If you don't have either of those and would rather not install them then you should still be able to veiw most pages correctly.
