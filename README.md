# the-beatles-website
A website I made for my Web Development course in University using HTML, CSS, and PHP

In order to view the 'website' (it's really just a bunch of files on your computer) as intended you'll need the ability to run php files locally.  I accomplished this by downloading something called XAMPP which allows you to run PHP files offline from your own PC.  It also comes with SQL which was used to store the discography information.

You can still open the files in the web browser but it won't resemble a website at all since PHP code is used to include the common functionality across multiple pages.
