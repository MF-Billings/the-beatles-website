				<p>John Winston Ono Lennon was born in Liverpool, England on 9th October 1940. 
				He is generally regarded by many to have founded The Beatles and is often seen 
				by historians as the band's leader despite the four strong personalities within 
				the group. Indeed, when people refer to The Beatles individually it is usually 
				John's name spoken first. John's personal history is also the most dramatized 
				out of the four Beatles, although this could have something to do with the tragic 
				circumstances of his death in 1980.</p>
				
				<p>Lennon began his musical career at the age of 16 when he founded the Quarrymen in 
				1956. This band was initially made up of Lennon on guitar and lead vocals and his 
				schoolmates Len Garry, Pete Shotton, Rod Davis, Eric Griffiths and Colin Hanton. A 
				few other friends of Lennon came in and out of the Quarrymen but it was a summer 
				day in 1957 when at a church fete gig a young Paul McCartney, who himself played 
				guitar and sang, was watching the Quarrymen play. Lennon & McCartney briefly 
				met but it was their destiny to be together and a short time later, Paul 
				McCartney had joined the Quarrymen and the two quickly carved up the atmosphere
				together. Paul introduced John to another guitar player, George Harrison.</p>
				
				<p>These three would form a tight bond together as the other members of the 
				Quarrymen faded away and the band became The Beatles. When Ringo joined in 
				1962, the puzzle was complete and The Beatles became the biggest phenomenon 
				that the world has ever seen. John Lennon left The Beatles in 1969 with Paul 
				McCartney announcing the split publicly in April 1970. Lennon embarked on a 
				solo career with wife Yoko Ono which sometimes saw him collaborate with George
				and Ringo on their albums and vice versa.</p> 
				
				<p>In 1975, John decided to retire from music and dedicate his time to his 
				family and he remained in retirement for 5 years until in October 1980 he 
				released a single with the album 'Double Fantasy' following in November. 
				What was to be a new beginning for John was tragically ended on 8th December
				1980 when a mentally ill person who claimed to be a fan shot him dead in the
				doorway to the Dakota apartment building where Lennon lived in New York City. 
				This sudden and tragic end to the life of John sparked outpourings of grief 
				worldwide, not least by his three former bandmates in The Beatles. George 
				released 'All Those Years Ago' as a tribute to his late friend and Paul 
				wrote 'Here Today' which he still performs live today in honour of his 
				old songwriting partner.</p>

				<p>James Paul McCartney was born in Liverpool, England on the 18th June 1942. He is
				regarded by many to be the most musically proficient Beatle, teaching himself a number
				of instruments such as Piano, Drums, Guitar and his primary instrument, Bass. Paul 
				studied at the Liverpool Institute with George Harrison, who was in the year below 
				him and both of them became friends due to their love of music. When they both joined
				the Quarrymen their path together was set for the next 12 years as the Quarrymen
				became the world famous Beatles.</p>
				
				<p>Paul was very driven to be successful from the beginning and it is said that he
				once took Brian Epstein aside and quietly told him that if The Beatles didn't become 
				famous that he would still like him to be his manager. Paul has gotten an unfair
				amount of criticism for his role in The Beatles break-up, mainly due to McCartney's
				use of the announcement to sell his debut solo record 'McCartney' in 1970. After the
				death of Brian Epstein, Paul became The Beatles' artistic manager, it was never an
				official position but that is the best way to describe his role in the management
				of The Beatles after Epstein.</p>
				
				<p>McCartney was unwilling to sign up notorious American businessman Allen Klein
				as The Beatles manager which angered John, George & Ringo who had already agreed
				that he would handle their affairs. Also, many have cited John Lennon's immediate
				post Beatles interviews where Lennon was harsh in his treatment of his former
				songwriting partner.</p>
				
				<p>As it turned out though, Paul was right to steer clear of Allen Klein as he 
				screwed over John & George's affairs in the 1970s. After The Beatles split, McCartney
				formed Wings with his wife Linda and ex-Moody Blues guitarist Denny Laine in the
				1970s and continued to release albums with them. In 1973, Wings became the first
				rock band to record the theme to a James Bond film, 'Live and Let Die'.</p>

				<p>Wings went through many line-up changes until early 1980 when Paul got busted
				in Japan for possession of Marijuana. This effectively ended Wings and when
				McCartney learned of the death of his friend and former band mate John Lennon,
				it scared Paul from performing live until 1989 when he put a new band together
				and went out on a world tour. Paul still continues to play live to this day.</p>

				<p>George Harrison (25 February 1943 - 29 November 2001) was an English musician,
				multi-instrumentalist, singer and songwriter and music and film producer who achieved
				international fame as the lead guitarist of The Beatles. Although John Lennon and Paul
				McCartney were the band's primary songwriters, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards 
				contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included "Taxman", 
				"Within You Without You", "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", "Here Comes the Sun" and 
				"Something", the last of which became The Beatles' second-most-covered song.</p>

				<p>Harrison's earliest musical influences included Big Bill Broonzy, George Formby
				and Django Reinhardt; Chet Atkins, Chuck Berry and Ry Cooder were significant later
				influences. By 1965 he had begun to lead The Beatles into folk rock through his
				interest in the Byrds and Bob Dylan, and towards Indian classical music through
				his use of the sitar on "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)". He developed an
				interest in the Hare Krishna movement and became an admirer of Indian culture
				and mysticism, introducing them to the other members of The Beatles and their 
				Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. After 
				the band's break-up in 1970, Harrison released the triple album All Things Must 
				Pass, a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single,
				"My Sweet Lord", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the slide 
				guitar. He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician 
				Ravi Shankar, a precursor for later benefit concerts such as Live Aid. Harrison 
				was a music and film producer as well as a musician; he founded Dark Horse 
				Records in 1974 and co-founded HandMade Films in 1978.</p>

				<p>Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer, and
				in 1988 co-founded the platinum-selling supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. A prolific
				recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by Badfinger, Ronnie 
				Wood and Billy Preston, and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, Eric Clapton, 
				Ringo Starr and Tom Petty, among others. Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 11 
				in their list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time". He is a two-time Rock and 
				Roll Hall of Fame inductee - as a member of The Beatles in 1988, and (posthumously) for
				his solo career in 2004.</p>

				<p>Harrison's first marriage, to model Pattie Boyd in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977.
				The following year he married Olivia Harrison, with whom he had one son,
				Dhani Harrison. Harrison died in 2001, aged 58, from lung cancer. He was cremated and
				his ashes were scattered in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India, in a private ceremony 
				according to Hindu tradition. He left an estate of almost &pound;100 million.</p>

				<p>Richard Starkey (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English
				musician and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for The Beatles. He 
				occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including "With a Little
				Help from My Friends", "Yellow Submarine" and their cover of "Act Naturally". He also 
				wrote The Beatles' songs "Don't Pass Me By" and "Octopus's Garden", and is credited as 
				a co-writer of others, such as "What Goes On" and "Flying".</p>
				
				<p>Starr was twice afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and as
				a result of prolonged hospitalisations fell behind in school. In 1955, he entered
				the workforce and briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an 
				apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became 
				interested in the UK skiffle craze, developing a fervent admiration for the genre. 
				In 1957, he cofounded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned 
				several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll
				by early 1958.</p>
				
				<p>When The Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, 
				Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success with that band in the 
				UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined The Beatles in August 1962, replacing
				Pete Best. Starr played key roles in The Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. 
				After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the
				US number four hit "It Don't Come Easy", and number ones "Photograph" and "You're Sixteen".
				In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, "Back Off Boogaloo", which peaked at
				number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which 
				was a top ten release in both the UK and the US. He has been featured in a number of d
				ocumentaries and hosted television shows. He also narrated the first two series of the 
				children's television programme Thomas & Friends and portrayed "Mr Conductor" during the 
				first season of the PBS children's television series Shining Time Station. Since 1989, 
				he has toured with twelve variations of Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band.</p>
				
				<p>Starr's creative contribution to music has received praise from drummers such as Phil
				Collins, who described him as "a great musician",[3] and Steve Smith, who commented: 
				"Before Ringo, drum stars were measured by their soloing ability and virtuosity. 
				Ringo's popularity brought forth a new paradigm ... we started to see the drummer 
				as an equal participant in the compositional aspect ... His parts are so signature
				to the songs that you can listen to a Ringo drum part without the rest of the music
				and still identify the song."[4] He was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame 
				in 1998. In 2011, Rolling Stone readers named Starr the fifth-greatest drummer of all 
				time. Starr, who was previously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a 
				Beatle in 1988, was inducted for his solo career in 2015, making him one of 21 
				performers inducted more than once.</p>
