				<h1>An Extensive Biography</h1>
				<p>
					The impact of The Beatles has often been noted but cannot be overstated.
					The "Fab Four" from Liverpool, England, startled the ears and energized
					the lives of virtually all who heard them. Their arrival triggered the
					musical revolution of the Sixties, introducing a modern sound and
					viewpoint that parted ways with the world of the previous decade. The
					pleasurable jolt at hearing "She Loves You" and "I Want to Hold Your
					Hand" - given the doldrums into which rock and roll had fallen in recent
					years - was comparable to the collective fever induced by Presley's
					"That's All Right" and "Heartbreak Hotel" nearly 10 years earlier.
				</p>
				<p>
					Every record was a shock when it came out. Compared to rabid R&amp;B
					evangelists like the Rolling Stones, The Beatles arrived sounding like
					nothing else. They had already absorbed Buddy Holly, the Everly Brothers
					and Chuck Berry, but they were also writing their own songs. They made
					writing your own material expected, rather than exceptional. As
					musicians, The Beatles proved that rock &amp; roll could embrace a
					limitless variety of harmonies, structures, and sounds; virtually every
					rock experiment has some precedent on Beatles records.
        </p>
        <p>As a unit the Beatles were a synergistic combination: Paul McCartney's melodic bass
					lines, Ringo Starr's slaphappy no-rolls drumming, George Harrison's
					rockabilly-style guitar leads, John Lennon's assertive rhythm guitar -
					and their four fervent voices. As personalities, they defined and
					incarnated Sixties style: smart, idealistic, playful, irreverent,
					eclectic. Their music, from the not-so-simple love songs they started
					with to their later perfectionistic studio extravaganzas, set new
					standards for both commercial and artistic success in pop.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lennon was performing with his amateur skiffle group the Quarrymen at a
					church picnic on July 6, 1957, in the Liverpool suburb of Woolton when he
					met McCartney, whom he later invited to join his group; soon they were
					writing songs together, such as "The One After 909." By the year's end
					McCartney had convinced Lennon to let Harrison join their group, the name
					of which was changed to Johnny and the Moondogs in 1958. In 1960 an
					art-school friend of Lennon's, Stu Sutcliffe, became their bassist.
					Sutcliffe couldn't play a note but had recently sold one of his paintings
					for a considerable sum, which the group, now rechristened the Silver
					Beetles (from which "Silver" was dropped a few months later, and
					"Beetles" amended to "Beatles"), used to upgrade its equipment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tommy Moore was their drummer until Pete Best replaced him in August
					1960. Once Best had joined, the band made its first of four trips to
					Hamburg, Germany. In December Harrison was deported back to England for
					being underage and lacking a work permit, but by then their 30-set weeks
					on the stages of Hamburg beer houses had honed and strengthened their
					repertoire (mostly Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Carl Perkins, and Buddy
					Holly covers), and on February 21, 1961, they debuted at the Cavern club
					on Mathew Street in Liverpool, beginning a string of nearly 300
					performances there over the next couple of years.
				</p>
				
				<figure class="pic">

					<figcaption>The Beatles' first performance at the Cavern Club with their current drummer at the time, Pete Best</figcaption>
				</figure>
				
				<p>
					In April 1961 they again went to Hamburg, where Sutcliffe (the first of
					The Beatles to wear his hair in the long, shaggy style that came to be
					known as the Beatle haircut) left the group to become a painter, while
					McCartney switched from rhythm guitar to bass. The Beatles returned to
					Liverpool as a quartet in July. Sutcliffe died from a brain hemorrhage in
					Hamburg less than a year later.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Beatles had been playing regularly to packed houses at the Cavern
					when they were spotted on November 9 by Brian Epstein (b. Sep. 19, 1934,
					Liverpool). After being discharged from the British Army on medical
					grounds, Epstein had attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London
					for a year before returning to Liverpool to manage his father's record
					store.
				</p>
				<p>
					The request he received for a German import single entitled "My
					Bonnie"(which The Beatles had recorded a few months earlier in Hamburg,
					backing singer Tony Sheridan and billed as the Beat Brothers) convinced
					him to check out the group. Epstein was surprised to discover not only
					that The Beatles weren't German but that they were one of the most
					popular local bands in Liverpool. Within two months he became their
					manager. Epstein cleaned up their act, eventually replacing black leather
					jackets, tight jeans, and pompadours with collarless gray Pierre Cardin
					suits and mildly androgynous haircuts.
				</p>
				<p>
					Epstein tried landing The Beatles a record contract, but nearly every
					label in Europe rejected the group. In May 1962, however, producer George
					Martin (b. Jan. 3, 1926, North London, Eng.) signed the group to EMI's
					Parlophone subsidiary. Pete Best, then considered the group's undisputed
					sex symbol, was asked to leave the group on August 16, 1962, and Ringo
					Starr, drummer with a popular Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the
					Hurricanes, was added, just in time for the group's first recording
					session. On September 11 The Beatles cut two originals, "Love Me Do" b/w
					"P.S. I Love You," which became their first U.K. Top 20 hit in October.
					In early 1963 "Please Please Me" went to Number Two, and they recorded an
					album of the same name in one 10-hour session on February 11, 1963. With
					the success of their third English single, "From Me to You" (Number One),
					the British record industry coined the term "Merseybeat" (after the river
					that runs through Liverpool) for groups such as The Beatles and Gerry and
					the Pacemakers, Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas, and the Searchers.
				</p>

				<p>
					By mid-year The Beatles were given billing over Roy Orbison on a national
					tour, and the hysterical outbreaks of <em>Beatlemania</em> had begun.
					Following their first tour of Europe in October, they moved to London
					with Epstein. Constantly mobbed by screaming fans, The Beatles required
					police protection almost any time they were seen in public. Late in the
					year "She Loves You" became the biggest-selling single in British history
					(in the years since, only six other singles have sold more copies there).
					In November 1963 the group performed before the Queen Mother at the Royal
					Command Variety Performance.
				</p>
				<p>
					EMI's American label, Capitol, had not released the group's 1963 records
					(which Martin licensed to independents like Vee-Jay and Swan with little
					success) but was finally persuaded to release its fourth single, "I Want
					to Hold Your Hand," and Meet The Beatles (identical to The Beatles'
					second British album, With The Beatles) in January 1964 and to invest
					$50,000 in promotion for the then unknown British act. The album and the
					single became The Beatles' first U.S. chart-toppers. On February 7
					screaming mobs met them at New York City's Kennedy Airport, and more than
					70 million people watched each of their appearances on The Ed Sullivan
					Show on February 9 and 16. In April 1964 "Can't Buy Me Love" became the
					first record to top American and British charts simultaneously, and that
					same month The Beatles held the top five positions on Billboard singles
					chart ("Can't Buy Me Love," "Twist and Shout," "She Loves You," "I Want
					to Hold Your Hand," "Please Please Me").
				</p>
				<p>
					Their first movie, A Hard Day's Night (directed by Richard Lester),
					opened in America in August; it grossed $1.3 million in its first week.
					The band was aggressively merchandised - Beatle wigs, Beatle clothes,
					Beatle dolls, lunch boxes, a cartoon series - from which, because of
					Epstein's ineptitude at business, the band made surprisingly little
					money. The Beatles also opened the American market to such British
					Invasion groups as the Dave Clark Five, the Rolling Stones, and the
					Kinks.
				</p>

				</figure>
				
				<p>
					By 1965 Lennon and McCartney rarely wrote songs together, although by
					contractual and personal agreement songs by either of them were credited
					to both. The Beatles toured Europe, North America, the Far East, and
					Australia that year. Their second movie, Help! (also directed by Lester),
					was filmed in England, Austria, and the Bahamas in the spring and opened
					in the U.S. in August. On August 15 they performed to 55,600 fans at New
					York's Shea Stadium, setting a record for largest concert audience.
					McCartney's "Yesterday" (Number One, 1965) would become one of the most
					often covered songs ever written.
				</p>
				<p>
					In June the Queen of England had announced that The Beatles would be
					awarded the MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire). The
					announcement sparked some controversy - some MBE holders returned their
					medal - but on October 26, 1965, the ceremony took place at Buckingham
					Palace. (Lennon returned his medal in 1969 as an antiwar gesture.
					Interestingly, even though he rejected the medal, the honor itself cannot
					be returned; Lennon technically remained an MBE.)
				</p>
				<p>
					With 1965's Rubber Soul, The Beatles' ambitions began to extend beyond
					love songs and pop formulas. Their success led adults to consider them,
					along with Bob Dylan, spokesmen for youth culture, and their lyrics grew
					more poetic and somewhat more political.
				</p>
				<p>
					In summer 1966 controversy erupted when a remark Lennon had made to a
					British newspaper reporter months before was widely reported in the U.S.
					The quote - "Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn't
					argue with that; I'm right and will be proved right. We're more popular
					than Jesus now" - incited denunciations and Beatles record bonfires. The
					anti-Beatles backlash was particularly intense in the U.S., where the
					group was set to begin a tour just two weeks after the controversy
					erupted, and included death threats against the group. Largely out of
					concern for the safety of his fellow band members, Lennon apologized at a
					Chicago press conference.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Beatles gave up touring after an August 29, 1966, concert at San
					Francisco's Candlestick Park and made the rest of their music in the
					studio, where they had begun to experiment with exotic instrumentation
					("Norwegian Wood," 1965, had featured sitar) and tape abstractions such
					as the reversed tracks on "Rain." "Strawberry Fields Forever," part of a
					double-sided single released in February 1967 to fill the unusually long
					gap between albums, featured an astonishing display of electronically
					altered sounds and hinted at what was to come. With "Taxman" and "Love
					You To" on Revolver, Harrison began to emerge as a songwriter.
				</p>
				<p>
					It took four months and $75,000 to record Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts
					Club Band using a then state-of-the-art four-track tape recorder and
					building each cut layer by layer. Released in June 1967, it was hailed as
					serious art for its "concept" and its range of styles and sounds, a
					lexicon of pop and electronic noises; such songs as "Lucy in the Sky With
					Diamonds" and "A Day in the Life" were carefully examined for hidden
					meanings. The album spent 15 weeks at Number One (longer than any of
					their others) and has sold over 8 million copies. On June 25, 1967, the
					Beatles recorded their new single, "All You Need Is Love," before an
					international television audience of 400 million, as part of a broadcast
					called Our World.
				</p>
				<p>
					On August 27, 1967 - while the four were in Wales beginning their
					six-month involvement with Transcendental Meditation and the Maharishi
					Mahesh Yogi (which took them to India for two months in early 1968) -
					Epstein died alone in his London flat from an overdose of sleeping pills,
					later ruled accidental. Shaken by Epstein's death, The Beatles retrenched
					under McCartney's leadership in the fall and filmed Magical Mystery Tour,
					which was aired by BBC-TV on December 26, 1967, and later released in the
					U.S. as a feature film. Although the telefilm was panned by British
					critics, fans, and Queen Elizabeth herself, the soundtrack album
					contained their most cryptic work yet in "I Am the Walrus," a Lennon
					composition.
				</p>
				<p>
					As The Beatles' late-1967 single "Hello Goodbye" went to Number One in
					both the U.S. and Britain, the group launched the Apple clothes boutique
					in London. McCartney called the retail effort "Western communism"; the
					boutique closed in July 1968. Like their next effort, Apple Corps Ltd.
					(formed in January 1968 and including Apple Records, which signed James
					Taylor, Mary Hopkin, and Badfinger), it was plagued by mismanagement. In
					July the group faced its last hysterical crowds at the premiere of Yellow
					Submarine, an animated film by Czech avant-garde designer and artist
					Heinz Edelmann featuring four new Beatles songs; a revised soundtrack
					featuring nine extra songs was released in 1999 (Number 15).
				</p>
				<p>
					In August they released McCartney's "Hey Jude" (Number One), backed by
					Lennon's "Revolution" (Number 12), which sold over 6 million copies
					before the end of 1968 - their most popular single. Meanwhile, the group
					had been working on the double album The Beatles (frequently called the
					White Album), which showed their divergent directions. The rifts were
					artistic - Lennon moving toward brutal confessionals, McCartney leaning
					toward pop melodies, Harrison immersed in Eastern spirituality - and
					personal, as Lennon drew closer to his wife-to-be, Yoko Ono. Lennon and
					Ono's Two Virgins (with its full frontal and back nude cover photos) was
					released the same month as The Beatles and stirred up so much outrage
					that the LP had to be sold wrapped in brown paper. (The Beatles, went to
					Number One, Two Virgins peaked at Number 124.)
				</p>
				<p>
					The Beatles attempted to smooth over their differences in early 1969 at
					filmed recording sessions. When the project fell apart hundreds of hours
					of studio time later, no one could face editing the tapes (a project that
					eventually fell to record producer Phil Spector), and "Get Back" (Number
					One, 1969) was the only immediate release. Released in spring 1970, Let
					It Be is essentially a documentary of their breakup, including an
					impromptu January 30, 1969, rooftop concert at Apple Corps headquarters,
					their last public performance as The Beatles.
				</p>
				
				<figure class="pic center">

				</figure>
				<p>
					By spring 1969 Apple was losing thousands of pounds each week. Over
					McCartney's objections, the other three brought in manager Allen Klein to
					straighten things out; one of his first actions was to package nonalbum
					singles as Hey Jude. With money matters temporarily out of mind, the four
					joined forces in July and August 1969 to record Abbey Road, featuring an
					extended suite as well as more hits, including Harrison's much-covered
					"Something" (Number Three, 1969). While its release that fall spurred a
					"Paul Is Dead" rumor based on clues supposedly left throughout their
					work, Abbey Road became The Beatles' best-selling album, at 9 million
					copies.
        </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, internal bickering persisted. In September Lennon told
					the others, "I'm leaving the group. I've had enough. I want a divorce."
					But he was persuaded to keep quiet while their business affairs were
					untangled. On April 10, 1970, McCartney released his first solo album and
					publicly announced the end of The Beatles. At the same time, Let It Be
					finally surfaced, becoming the group's 14th Number One album (a
					postbreakup compilation would become their 15th in 1973) and yielding the
					Beatles' 18th and 19th chart-topping singles, "Let It Be" and "The Long
					and Winding Road."
				</p>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Post Break-up</h2>
					<p>
						Throughout the Seventies, as repackages of Beatles music continued to
						sell, the four were hounded by bids and pleas for a reunion. Lennon's
						murder by a mentally disturbed fan on December 8, 1980, ended those
						speculations. In 1988 The Beatles were inducted into the Rock and Roll
						Hall of Fame. McCartney, citing business conflicts with the two other
						surviving members, did not attend. Relations between him and Harrison, in
						particular, had been strained for some time.
					</p>
					<p>
						In January 1994 Goldmine magazine reported that McCartney, Harrison, and
						Starr had begun recording music for a long-rumored Beatles documentary
						the previous August, with more secret sessions scheduled. There were
						other signs that the three band members were on the mend - when Lennon
						was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist in 1994,
						for instance, McCartney did the honors (McCartney himself was inducted in
						1999). Later in 1994 Live at the BBC was released, featuring 56 songs the
						Beatles performed on the British radio between 1962 and 1965. It debuted
						at Number One in the U.K.; in the U.S., it debuted and peaked at Number
						Three.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Beatles Anthology, the long-awaited six-hour television special, was
						broadcast over three nights in November 1995, coinciding with the release
						of the George Martin-compiled double-CD Anthology 1 (Number One), which
						featured alternate takes, demos, and rare tracks, and premiered the first
						new song by John, Paul, George, and Ringo since 1970. "Free as a Bird"
						(Number Six, 1995), a demo recorded by Lennon in 1977, was completed by
						the other three and produced by Jeff Lynne; it became The Beatles 34th
						Top 10 single. Lennon's lyrics didn't extend much beyond the title, and
						so Harrison and McCartney collaborated on lyrics for a new bridge.
					</p>
					<p>
						Two additional double CDs, Anthology 2 and 3 (both Number One), followed
						in 1996, as well as an extended videotape version of the documentary.
						Anthology 2's "Real Love" (again a Lennon demo, from 1979, with modern
						additions by the others) reached Number 11 and became the group's 23rd
						gold single (the most of any group).
					</p>
					<p>
						The Liverpool juggernaut continued to roll on in 2000: The Beatles became
						the highest certified act of all time, with over 113 million albums sold
						in America (which grew to 170 million albums in 2008); a coffee table
						book, The Beatles Anthology, topped the New York Times bestseller list;
						and 1, a collection of the band's Number One hit songs, became the
						Beatles' 19th chart-topping album, selling 25 million copies by 2005.
					</p>
					<p>
						On November 29, 2001, George Harrison, diagnosed with lung cancer in the
						late 1990s, became the second Beatle to pass away. Three years later
						Capitol Records released all of The Beatles' U.S. albums (in both stereo
						and original mono versions) as two box sets, The Capitol Albums, Vols. 1
						and 2. In 2006, George Martin and his son Giles produced a set of Beatles
						remixes, Love, for the soundtrack to Cirque du Soleil's theater
						production of the same name. The following year, McCartney and Starr
						appeared on CNN's Larry King Live to talk about the project; they joined
						Beatles widows Ono and Olivia Harrison in Las Vegas to celebrate the Love
						production's first anniversary.
					</p>
					<p>
						Until 2007, The Beatles' Apple Corp. was in legal limbo with the Apple,
						Inc. computer company over use of the name. Apple Corp. had sued Apple,
						Inc. after the computer company opened its online iTunes music store; one
						result of the suit was that The Beatles' group and solo music was not
						made available for digital download. In February 2007, the two sides came
						to an agreement. Apple, Inc. would retain ownership of the name and
						license it back to the Apple Corp. record label. By October, all of the
						Beatles' solo works were available on iTunes, but as of early 2010 the
						Beatles catalogue was still not available on iTunes.
					</p>
					<p>
						September 9, 2009 was a day of 21st century Beatlemania: Apple/EMI
						released remastered versions of the band's studio albums, with
						dramatically improved sound. (Mono versions were also available, though
						only as a box.) Also that day, The Beatles Rock Band video game hit
						shelves, featuring 45 Beatle songs; by the end of 2009, it had sold more
						than one million copies worldwide.
					</p>
					<p>
						McCartney and Starr continued to tour and record throughout the 2000s.
						McCartney, who is reportedly a billionaire, released three solo albums
						during the decade as well as three live albums, including Good Evening
						New York City, which documented the inaugural concerts at New York's Citi
						Field in 2009. Starr released three albums in the 2000s, as well as
						2010's Y Not. He appeared with McCartney at several events, including
						2002's Concert for George, a charitable event held on the first
						anniversary of Harrison's death.
